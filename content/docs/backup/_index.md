# Introduction

I have a complex system of backups, yes, I'm a bit maniac of backups.
Loosing all my pics (~40000) for more than 20 years is not an option!
I have backups of everything and everywhere. Lot of times is a bit a nightmare when I try to find where and 
how to recover something.

I'm using [Borg](https://www.borgbackup.org/) as main software.I was using restic for a while but I was running a
lot of problems and I changed. Since then, I'm happy with Borg. I must admit that is not easy but when you understand
a bit is really powerful and works perfectly for me. We have all the commands I use here: [Borg commands](/docs/backup/borg)
