# Documentation

I've been several years taking notes for repeating task again and again.
Lately, I though that was enough and I re-take the old idea of writing everything in
a format that could be used later.

I started the new software section in <https://riesco.ch> with this idea but since is used for music, photography, etc,
is being difficult to maintain and update.

So, I start taking notes with VSCode and sharing between all my machines. That has been working well but
each time I want to access whatever note I have to log into the system, check it, etc. So, next steep, put all
the notes in my website but.. Wordpress is not done for that. I don't want to be online all time and since I'm
using DIVI for the formatting, adding a simple page takes sometimes hours.

Checking around I found HUGO. I liked the idea of putting the notes *easily* in the web.
I've been playing around with themes, etc, trying to understand how it works. I was closed to abandon when I
found this theme that makes me see HUGO much simpler. So, here we go!!
